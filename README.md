# Interactive Story
Fourth app of the [Treehouse iOS Development Techdegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/ios-development).


One of the most fundamental types of apps is one with a hierarchical data model and style of navigation. Interactive Story is an iOS app that employs these two features and allows the user to take decisions and make his own adventure. The app uses Navigation Controllers, the iOS Notification Center, and the System Sounds API.
